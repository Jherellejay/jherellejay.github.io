			<h4>How do I book in for a tattoo</h4>
			<p>To begin the process of booking your tattoo, please use the <a href="/contact">enquiry form</a>. Make sure you include size & placement as a minimum, as well as anything else you feel would be helpful i.e. reference images & budget. Once we have discussed your ideas, I will either ask you to come in for a face to face consultation or you can book straight in via the studio directly. You can only do this once I've given you an estimate.</p>
			
			<h4>Do I need to pay a deposit?</h4>
			<p>All bookings require a minimum deposit of £50, ideally to be paid in cash in the studio, alternatively we can accept PayPal payment. All deposits are non-refundable, but are transferrable if you wish to move your appointment.</p>
			
			<h4>How much do you charge?</h4>
			<p>My current prices are £60ph or £250 per day, a full day sitting is 11am-4:30pm with a 30 minute lunch break.</p>
			
			<h4>Do I need to have a consultation?</h4>
			<p>Face-to-face consultations are the best way to book a tattoo. It makes it easier for me to understand what exactly you are looking for and how I can achieve that. I understand these may not always be possible which is why I have an enquiry form and can consult with you via email.</p>
			
			<h4>Will I see my design before the day of my tattoo?</h4>
			<p>Generally I will book enough time in your appointment to allow for any changes to be made. As my diary is busy I can only draw designs a day or two in advance and may not have the time to do further consultations.</p>
			
			<h4>What happens if I need to cancel/reschedule my appointment?</h4>
			<p>If you need to cancel your tattoo entirely please be considerate and try to give at least 48 hours notice. The same applies for re-scheduling. Deposits can only be carried over if the correct notice period has been given. Deposits will not be refunded for cancelled appointments.</p>
