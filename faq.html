				<h4>How do I book in for a tattoo</h4>
				<p>To begin the process of booking your tattoo, please use the <a href="/contact">enquiry form</a>. Make sure you include size & placement as a minimum, as well as anything else you feel would be helpful i.e. reference images & budget. Once we have discussed your ideas, I will either ask you to come in for a face to face consultation or you can book straight in via the studio directly. You can only do this once I've given you a price & time quote.</p>
				
				<h4>Do I need to pay a deposit?</h4>
				<p>All booking require a minimum deposit of £50, ideally to be paid in cash in the studio, alternatively we can accept PayPal payment. All deposits are non-refundable.</p>
				
				<h4>How much do you charge?</h4>
				<p>My current prices are £60ph or £250 per day, a full day sitting is 11am-4:30pm with a 30 minute lunch break.</p>
				
				<h4>Do I need to have a consultation?</h4>
				<p>Face-to-face consultations are te best way to book a tattoo. It makes it easier for me to understand what eactly you are looking for and how I can achieve that. Although I understand these may not always be possible which is why I have an enquiry form and can consult with you via email.</p>
				
				<h4>Will I see my design before the day of my tattoo?</h4>
				<p>Generally i will book enouugh time in your appointment toallow for any change to be made. As my diary is busy I can only draw designs a day or two in advance and may not have the time to do further consultations.</p>
				
				<h4>What happens if I need to cancel/reschedule my appointment?</h4>
				<p>If you need to cancel your tattoo entirely please be considerate and try to give at least 48 hours notice. The same applies for re-scheduling. Deposits can only be carried over if the correct notice period has been given. Deposits will not be refunded for cancelled appintments.</p>
